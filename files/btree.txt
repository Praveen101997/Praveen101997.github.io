1. What is BTREE



We have 4 tabs in our project

1st tab is out home tab in which we are describing our project
for what purpose this can be implemented

next tab is Data Tab
In which we are generating our random data to use it as raw data in project
the output data is of combination of serial no, Name, Username, Password

And Our goal is to create a system to search record in database in minimum time

FOr that Purpose We have 3rd tab named Indices
In which we Convert our raw data in processed data

But before that we first calculate search time in database with indexing which we will done in Indices Tab
Then We will processed our data Using Indices using respective entities which is Name, Username, Password
Then We will again calculate search time in database using Query Tab 

After Doing These Steps Will will see that Search time in database after indexing is much lesser than Before indexing
